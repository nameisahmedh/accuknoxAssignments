    "What it does\n",
    "- Prepares data by filling missing values, encoding text, scaling numbers\n",
    "- Trains 7 different machine learning models (RandomForest, XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM, KNN, LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes)\n",
    "- Compares which model works best\n",
    "- Makes predictions on new data\n",
    "- Saves and loads trained models\n",
